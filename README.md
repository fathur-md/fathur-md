## Hi there 👋 

I’m **Fathur**, an Informatics student passionate about building useful and creative projects. 
I enjoy experimenting with new tech stacks, improving performance, and learning by doing.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on something cool (and probably breaking it in the process 🚀)  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning from [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com) and other open-source resources    
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with mastering clean code and performance optimization    
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him  
- ⚡ Fun fact #1: I believe coffee is the best dependency in any project ☕
- ⚡ Fun fact #2: My cat once walked across my keyboard and somehow fixed a bug 🐱⌨️
